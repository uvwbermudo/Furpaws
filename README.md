# Furpaws
- A social media for pet lovers and a freelancing platform for pet care services.
  
## This is one of the first websites that I have ever made (School Project)
- It is made out of spaghetti.
- It was made in a very short amount of time.
- Made with Flask, Bootstrap 5, HTMX, JavaScript FetchAPI, CSS, HTML, Flask Socket-IO

 ### You can:
 - Create a Post with photos/videos that gets put into a carousel.
 - Comment, like, and share posts.
 - Post job listings for freelancers to accept.
 - You can register as a freelancer to earn money.
 - Live messaging is available.

### Note that:
- I will be recreating this in the future with a different stack on a different repo.
- I will not update this repository as it has cemented its sentimental value to me.
- Thank you for reading and hope you enjoy looking at this mess!
